# Ferry
A Rustified package manager for python

# How to Use?
- Make sure you got Rust installed since I am not yet providing a built version :p
- Create a new project with `ferry new <project_name>` 
- Add your dependencies along with their versions under the `[dependencies]` heading in `ferry.toml`
- Install all the dependencies with `ferry fetch`
